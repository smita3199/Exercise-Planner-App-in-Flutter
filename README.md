# Exercise-Planner-App-in-Flutter

Exercise Planner App is a simple Android application built with Flutter that allows the user to create customizable workout routines by adding, editing and deleting exercises using the local SQLite database. The user can view all the added exercise details on the main screen and check them once completed. The alert dialog notifies the user when the exercise is saved, edited or deleted. The user can also track their current location and view nearby places using the Google Maps API.
